# Vapor TIL

This is the Vapor TIL (Today I Learned) application that is used throughout the [Server Side Swift with Vapor](https://store.raywenderlich.com/products/server-side-swift-with-vapor) book. The first sections of the book take you through everything you need to know to get started with Vapor. Every chapter will deploy to Vapor Cloud, using this repository!

You'll learn how to build routes and use Fluent to interact with a database. You'll learn how to create dynamic websites with Leaf and authenticate APIs, websites and validate fields. The 2nd half of the book goes into more advanced topics, including WebSockets, caching and microservices.
